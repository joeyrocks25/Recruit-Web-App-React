# Recruitment Website

## Overview

This project is a recruitment website designed to provide a secure and interactive platform for job seekers and recruiters. The majority of the infrastructure is deployed in the cloud, and this web app was created to showcase scalability and modern cloud-native solutions. Emphasis was placed on implementing cloud design patterns, therefore the code could benefit from further tidying up and modularisation.
